I just approved a plan or completed a feature. Before we move on:

1. What are the 3 most important software concepts I should understand from what we just built?
2. For each concept, give me a succinct one-paragraph explanation + one resource to learn more
3. What patterns from this work will transfer to future projects?

Write this to .claude/learnings/[date]-[feature].md
